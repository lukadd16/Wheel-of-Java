# Wheel-of-Java
## About
Assignment for a High School Computer Science course. This is the first working build (which admittedly is terribly organized, I had to cut some corners to meet the due date).

## To-Do/Future Plans
I plan to return to this project and revamp it into something that is more object oriented + turn it into something presentable.

The first major version update will be an overhaul of file/class structure but also game logic/behaviour (so that the computer player actually plays more like a human one).

Second major update will possibly involve smarter computer contestants (undecided as to how I will achieve this, but machine learning sounds appealing)

Subsequent updates after that will focus on making a GUI version of the game, with spinner and all / maybe even making a web-accessable (or mobile app) version so that you can play the game anywhere.
